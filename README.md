# Nexus Network
Nexus is my Minecraft mini-games server accessible since version 1.8 and above from the login address: [nexus.agonkolgeci.com](https://fr.namemc.com/server/nexus.agonkolgeci.com?q=nexus.agonkolgeci.com).

The main purpose of this server is to list all the creations I've made over the years on Minecraft.
